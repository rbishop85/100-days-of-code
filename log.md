# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 3, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Working on various small tweaks on jackStands project.

**Thoughts** I need to stop taking extended breaks from this project.  I also need to get in the habit of updating my project notes with details about what I'm in the middle of working on, so that it's easier to jump back in the next time I work on it.

### Day 2: April 4, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Nothing to actually show today.  Decided to dive into trying to learn React Native as the jackStands app is intended to be a phone app.  I decided I needed to stop wasting time developing it as a webpage that scales for mobile screens and start learning how to build it into an actual app before it's more complicated and even harder to transfer over.

**Thoughts** For starters I need to start working a bit earlier when possible (Sleep is important).  I found a 12hour course on Youtube for React Native that looks promising.  I'm thinking I'll follow along with that to try and start learning how to use it.

### Day 3: April 5, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through first 8 sections of React Native Tutorial video on Youtube

**Thoughts** The general "rules" for the challenge say not to do tutorials but given my limited time restraints I figured taking the time to learn what I need to know to progress in my coding project was equally important.

### Day 4: April 6, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through sections 9 and 10 of React Native Tutorial video on Youtube

**Thoughts** Had some issues getting the virtual app to load right for the tutorial.  So I spent a bit fighting that, then once it got working I continued and got through the 2 sections.

### Day 5: April 7, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through sections 11 - 20 of React Native Tutorial video on Youtube

### Day 9: April 11, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Shorter day as work was 5.5hrs longer than usual.  Worked through sections 34 and 35.

**Thoughts** Halfway point!  Can't wait to put this to use on the app.

### Day 10: April 12, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed sections 36-42.

**Thoughts** Spent some time troubleshooting why I could display my test apps on my local android simulator, but not on my actual phone.  Turns out details are important, as my phone had switched default wireless networks so of course couldn't see the project on my computer...

### Day 12: April 14, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through sections 52-70 and finished the Tutorial.

**Thoughts** It all seems to make a fair amount of sense.  What the tutorial didn't cover was how to deal with local storage of data.  This will be my next challenge before I can really start writing my app.
